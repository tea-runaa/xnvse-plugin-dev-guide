# xnvse-plugin-dev-guide

A WIP guide on developing a plugin for the [New Vegas Script Extender](https://github.com/xNVSE/NVSE). As of right now, it's a very unfinished draft that is still being written. This repo was made to show progress and make corrections; I do not recommend following any steps in the guide in its current state.
